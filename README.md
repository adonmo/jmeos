# MEOS-java

A minimal proof of concept for using MEOS in Java.

We use JavaCpp to achieve this.

## Running the code
```sh
MEOS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/kc/Adonmo/code/meos/include
MEOS_LIB_PATH=/home/kc/Adonmo/code/meos/build/test/_deps/libmeos-build
gradle run
```
If you see the following output, the code ran successfully:
```
10.0
20.0
```
